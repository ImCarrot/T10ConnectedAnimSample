# T10ConnectedAnimSample
This is a quick sample for using Connected Animations with template 10 (The amazing developer framework) we all love!  
Now this is just a quick sample for a work around, I haven't spent a lot of time on it.

It's simple, the code is commented so I hope there is no trouble. Just incase there is some, feel free to use the issues tab. 

Moving forward, I will make it into a utility but for now, this is as simple as it gets. 

Thanks for using :)
